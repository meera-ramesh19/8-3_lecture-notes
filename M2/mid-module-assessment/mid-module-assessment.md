## Learning Objectives

- Use .map() to solve code problems.
- Use .filter() to solve code problems.
- Use .find() to solve code problems.
- Use .every() to solve code problems.
- Use .some() to solve code problems.
- Use .sort() to solve code problems.
- Use .forEach() to solve code problems.
- Use .reduce() to solve code problems.
- Throw errors with the throw keyword. <— lesson tomorrow
- Add default parameters to functions. , <— what are the default native array method’s parameters?
- Write functions using the arrow function expression syntax <— (Parameter) => { }

## Structure

> This challenge is designed to assess the JavaScript skills you have gained so far.

### Correctness

There are 7 functions that need to be written.

> - Each completed function (passes all the tests) will be worth 1 point.
>   - 7 functions pass all tests === 7 points
>   - 1 function passing all tests === 1 point
> - A minimum of 5 points must be attained in order to pass this assessment.
> - You may receive partial credit (0.5 points) for code that is close to passing the tests, but does not pass all the tests.
>   - 4 tests, and your function passes 3 === 0.5 points
> - If your function includes comments mapping out your code intentions (in pseudocode), this will help show what you were planning to do, and indicate to instructors whether you were on the right track or not.
>   - e.g.: 2 of 4 test passing and pseudocode in full for the other two test === more likely to get .5
>   - e.g.: 2 of 4 tests passing and no pseudocode, no code at all, or erroring code === less likely to get .5

### Reusability

TBD

### Readability

TBD

## Test Taking Best Practices

### How to Build to 5 points

Use the following strategies to build to 5 points.

> - 4 passing functions, 2 partially passing functions, 1 function failing all tests === 5 points (pass)
> - 3 passing functions, 4 partially passing functions === 5 points (pass)
> - 2 passing functions, 5 partially passing functions === 4.5 points (fail)

### Submitting Your Assessment

> You will have from 10am Monday morning, until 10:20am Tuesday

- You must be done with your work by 10am on Tuesday
- 10:00am - 10:20 will be used in class to create your Pull Requests
- Do not create a Pull Request before 10:00am on Tuesday, because we don’t want classmates to accidentally have access to your work.
  > - Complete the function so that the tests pass.
  > - Add and commit your changes.
  > - Push your code up to GitHub.
- Add and commit regularly. You should have at least 7 commits.
  - At least every time you build a function that passes all of the tests
  - Best practices: every time you build a passing test
  - You should not end up with a single additional commit for this assessment.
- DO NOT push up code that does not run
- Write code that is readable + reusable + correct

# M2 Mid Module Assessment

## Learning Objectives

> Consider studying topics in the following order if you need a recommendation:

1. Use .map() to solve code problems.
1. Use .filter() to solve code problems.
1. Use .find() to solve code problems.
1. Use .every() to solve code problems.
1. Use .some() to solve code problems.
1. Throw errors with the throw keyword. <— lesson tomorrow
1. Add default parameters to functions. , <— what are the default native array method’s parameters?
1. Write functions using the arrow function expression syntax <— (Parameter) => { }
1. Use .sort() to solve code problems.
1. Use .forEach() to solve code problems.
1. Use .reduce() to solve code problems.

## Structure

> This challenge is designed to assess the JavaScript skills you have gained so far.

### Correctness

> There are 7 functions that need to be written.

- Each completed function (passes all the tests) will be worth 1 point.
- 7 functions pass all tests === 7 points

> A minimum of 5 points must be attained in order to pass this assessment.
> You may receive partial credit (0.5 points) for code that is close to passing the tests, but does not pass all the tests.

- 4 tests, and your function passes 3 === 0.5 points

> If your code includes comments mapping out your intentions (in pseudocode), this will help show your logical strategy, and indicate whether you are on the right track. For examaple:

more likely to get .5:

- 2 of 4 test passing and pseudocode in full for the other two test

less likely to get .5:

- 2 of 4 tests passing and no pseudocode, no code at all, or erroring code

### Reusability

- Functions DO NOT have:
  - hardcoded conditionals
  - hardcoded values
  - global variables
- Code is adaptive to different kinds of data
- Edge-cases are handled thoughtfully, reminiscent of production-level code.
  - Early returns
  - DRY (don't repeat yoursef, lack of repetitive lines of code)

### Readability

> If variables are clearly and descriptively named, there should be no need for more than a few comments at most

- All functions use thoughtful and descriptive variables, wherever possible
- Comments are used to help explain the thought process behind certain functions and processes
- Code is indented properly
- Syntax, spacing, and new lines are consistent and conventional

## Test Taking Best Practices

### How to Build to 5 points

> Examples of strategies that build to 5 points.

- 4 passing functions, 2 partially passing functions, 1 function failing all tests === 5 points (pass)
- 3 passing functions, 4 partially passing functions === 5 points (pass)
- 2 passing functions, 5 partially passing functions === 4.5 points (fail)

### Submitting Your Assessment

> You will have from 10am Monday, until 10am Tuesday to work on your exam.

- You must be done with your work by 10am on Tuesday
- 10:00am - 10:20 Tuesday will be used in class to create your Pull Requests

> Do not create a Pull Request before 10:00am on Tuesday, because we don’t want classmates to accidentally have access to your work.

- Complete the function so that the tests pass.
- Add and commit your changes.
- Push your code up to GitHub.

> Add and commit regularly. You should have at least 7 commits.

- Good: commit at least every time you build a function that passes all of the tests
- Better: commit every time you build a passing test
- You should not end up with only one commit for this assessment.
- DO NOT push up code that does not run

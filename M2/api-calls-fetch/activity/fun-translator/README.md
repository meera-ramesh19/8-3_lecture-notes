The goal of this activity is to create a form in a webpage which translates text into a fun language, using any of the language translation APIs found [here](https://api.funtranslations.com/).

- The API request you will need to use to create this app is called a `POST` request, and each fun language API may have different usage requirements.
- Use `Postman` to test your API `POST` request before you integrate the call using `fetch` in your app.
- As a stretch goal, update the app's `CSS` to personalize it and make it mobile first

Here is a demo of an example fun translation app: [Ancient Sith Translator](https://lingojam.com/AncientSithTranslator)

After you've created a working version of your fun translator, consider the following questions:

```
- How could your code be improved?
- How could the user experience of your application be improved?
- What are some additional features you could add to this application?
```
